# mini-OS
The “mini OS” project simulates a basic operating system that allows users to create, manage, and manipulate files and folders with various functionalities. It supports three file types: images (img), videos (mp4), and text files (txt), each with specific attributes such as resolution for images, quality and duration for videos, and content for text files.

Key features include:

	•	Drive and Folder Management: Users can create drives, navigate folders, and manage folder structures.
	•	File Operations: Ability to create files with different formats, delete them, and rename them.
	•	Error Handling: The project includes validation and error messages for incorrect commands, file formats, or insufficient space.
	•	File Attributes: Files include various attributes like resolution for images, text content for text files, and video quality and length for video files.
	•	OS Information: The system also provides detailed status reports for drives, files, and folders, and tracks the most frequently accessed folders.

The project follows an object-oriented design, making it modular and easy to extend with new features.
